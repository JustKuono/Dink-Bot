# Dink-Bot
Node.js

This bot was created for the Dinkleberg's Gmod Public Discord. At the moment it has simple moderation commands such as tempmute, kick, and ban.
Other commands include bot info and server info which are available to everyone.
There are kinks in commands that need to be fixed that can cause deprecations, they don't really hinder any commands they're just annoying.
